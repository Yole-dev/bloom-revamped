          <p>Step 1 – Web Strategy</p>
          <p>
            We start by understanding your brand, goals, and industry. If you
            have a website, we assess it for improvement. With a focus on your
            audience’s needs, we craft a strategic plan—defining structure,
            wireframes, and content for a high-performing site.

          <p>Step 2 – Design</p>
          <p>
            The brain processes images faster than words, so we blend visuals,
            colors, fonts, and calls to action to captivate your audience. This
            ensures a seamless flow, builds trust, and guides visitors toward
            action.

          <p>Step 3 – Development</p>
          <p>
            Once the design is finalized, we move to development—building the
            theme, adding content, and ensuring flawless functionality. If
            needed, we also manage complex integrations like APIs, portals, and
            CRMs.
